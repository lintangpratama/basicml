This folder contain my ML learning path.

1. Data Preparation
   In this part, preprocessing is performed before it is used for the main model
   - Converting data to the dataframes
   - Scaling the data using normalization (transforming data to 0-1 range) and standardization (transforming data using Z-score)
   - Splitting the dataset into train set, validation set, and test set
   - Test the validation predict score (85% - 99% is great)
